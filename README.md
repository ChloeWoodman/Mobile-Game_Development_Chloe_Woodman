 Key ideas:
Use microphone for picking up audio to enable the dandelion to blow seeds to enable glide mechanics.
2 Inputs, touch screen and on-screen joysticks.
Framework API will be used to save data and progress externally to a server.
Monitization can be given by completing 4 levels, and payment to proceed for more.

White box design of a simple level of game with yellow flower as goal.
