 Key ideas:
Use microphone for picking up audio to enable the dandelion to blow seeds to enable glide mechanics.
2 Inputs, touch screen and on-screen joysticks.
Game will be developed for android due to the overall world having more androids than iPhones, plus android is universally accessible across multiple phone brands, and despite the USA and UK having more iPhone users, most of Europe consists of android users - thus ensuring the game will be available to a large audience.
Framework "Snapshots" API will be used to save data and progress externally to a server - details provided here https://developer.android.com/games/pgs/android/saved-games; this API provides a convenient method to save players' game progress to the Google Server, which can retrieve saved game data to allow players to return to continue playing their game at their last save point from any device - which means that they can have their progress even if their phone is dead or broken, they could even play the game on a tablet without losing nay progress and starting anew! 
Monitization can be given by completing 4 levels, and payment to proceed for more.

White box design of a simple level of game with yellow flower as goal.
